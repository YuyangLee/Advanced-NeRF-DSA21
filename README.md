# DS21-NeRF: (Not That) Advanced NeRF

> The term project C for Data Structure course, Fall 2021, Tsinghua University

In this project we, based on the incomplete code of **Ne**ural **R**adiance **F**ield,

- boost the training by implementing the **hierarchical sampling** in the paper,
- implement the 3D reconstruction for the trained scene,
- and boost the reconstruction using OCTree.

The code in this repository is based on a incomplete PyTorch version of NeRF and furtherimplemented by [Aiden Li](https://github.com/YuyangLee). Discussion and healthy arguments are welcome but **any plagiarism is forbidden**.
